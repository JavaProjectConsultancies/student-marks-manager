## Step 3: Configure Your App (2 minutes)

1. **Open your Student Marks Manager**

   - Click OK

3. **Test it**

## ðŸš¨ If You Still Get CORS Error

The error means you're trying to access the Google Sheet directly instead of the web app. Make sure:

1. You're using the **web app URL** (starts with `https://script.google.com/macros/s/`)
2. **NOT** the Google Sheet URL (starts with `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/`)

## Test Your Setup

Use `test_sync.html` to verify everything works:

1. Open `test_sync.html`
2. Paste your web app URL
3. Click "Test Connection"
4. Click "Test Sync"
5. Check your Google Sheet for test data

## Your Google Sheet Details

- **Sheet ID**: `1vKa94iz0uFpvkKKgHBQgWWHcncsjtZOw7coX2eYMgLI`
- **URL**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vKa94iz0uFpvkKKgHBQgWWHcncsjtZOw7coX2eYMgLI/edit

The script will automatically update this sheet with your student data!
